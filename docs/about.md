## <img src="../assets/hot-sauce.png" style="height:30px;"> bio

Stephanie Isan (she/they) is a queer, Taiwanese American writer and software engineer. 
Her work is published or forthcoming in: *Frontier Poetry*, and she was a finalist for the *Palette Poetry 2021 Prize* and longlisted for the *2021 Frontier Open*.

In her free time, she likes to, in no particular order: take long walks on air-conditioned treadmills at sunset, eat brunch with fancy mimosas, play video games, pet cats, dogspot, read her ever-growing Kindle library, and drink sriracha straight from the bottle. 

She currently lives with her sixteen crane machine plushies, two grumpy tabby cats, one howling beagle mix, and her partner <s> in a pear tree </s> on the US east coast.
